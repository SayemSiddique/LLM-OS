## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of LLM-OS seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [your-security-email@domain.com]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Considerations

### API Keys and Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys or sensitive environment variables to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production environments

### Authentication and Authorization
- Firebase Authentication is used for user management
- API routes should validate user permissions
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production

### Data Privacy
- User data is processed in accordance with privacy regulations
- Chat history and user preferences are stored securely
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Provide users with data export capabilities

### Content Security
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate file uploads and limit file types
- Implement CORS policies appropriately

### Infrastructure Security
- Use secure deployment practices
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Use security scanning tools

## Dependencies

We regularly update our dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- Automated dependency scanning
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Regular dependency updates
- Security testing in the build process

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before public disclosure
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid data destruction and disruption to our users
3. Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
4. Contact us immediately if you inadvertently access sensitive information

## Recognition

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
