# LLM-OS Demo Script

## üé¨ Quick Demo Instructions

### Step 1: Start the System
1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. Notice the beautiful glassmorphism design with the terminal in the center
3. Observe the sidebar with different panels: Shell, Launcher, Autonomy, Verifier

### Step 2: Test the Autonomy System
1. Click on "Autonomy" in the sidebar
2. **Move the autonomy slider** from Level 1 to Level 4
3. Notice the real-time visual feedback and color changes
4. Read the different behavior descriptions for each level

### Step 3: Experience the Intelligent Terminal
1. Return to "Shell" view
2. Try these commands to see the system in action:

**System Commands:**
```bash
help                    # See all available commands
status                  # Check system status
apps                    # List available applications  
clear                   # Clear terminal
```

**Natural Language:**
```bash
launch the writing assistant
show me system status
what can you help me with?
create a new file
```

### Step 4: Launch AI Applications
1. Click "Launcher" in the sidebar
2. **Click "Launch" on any app** (Writer AI, Code Agent, Research Assistant)
3. Notice how the terminal header changes to show the app context
4. Try talking to the specialized AI for that app
5. Type `exit` to return to the main shell

### Step 5: Monitor System Activity
1. Click "Visual Verifier" in the sidebar
2. Watch the **real-time system monitoring**
3. See autonomy level visualization
4. Observe AI processing activities appear and complete
5. Click on activities to see details

### Step 6: Test Autonomy Integration
1. Set autonomy to **Level 1 (Suggest Only)**
2. Ask the AI to "launch the code agent"
3. Notice it suggests but doesn't execute

4. Change autonomy to **Level 3 (Autonomous)**
5. Ask the same thing again
6. Notice it actually launches the app automatically

### Step 7: Experience the Complete Integration
1. **Move between all panels** using the sidebar
2. Notice how autonomy level affects behavior everywhere
3. Launch apps and see context switching
4. Watch real-time monitoring as you interact
5. Appreciate the smooth animations and visual feedback

## üéØ Key Things to Demonstrate

### ‚ú® **The Autonomy Slider Actually Works**
- It's not just a visual element
- Moving it changes AI behavior across the entire system
- You can see the difference in real-time

### ü§ñ **Natural Language to System Operations**
- Chat naturally with the AI
- It understands and executes system commands
- Seamless transition between conversation and action

### üì± **Real App Integration**
- Apps aren't mockups - they create actual AI contexts
- Each app has specialized capabilities and prompts
- Smooth switching between app contexts

### üëÅÔ∏è **Live System Monitoring**
- See exactly what the AI is doing
- Real-time activity tracking
- Visual feedback for all system states

### üé® **Production-Quality Design**
- Beautiful, modern interface
- Smooth animations throughout
- Consistent design system
- Responsive and accessible

## üí° Try These Advanced Interactions

1. **Multi-level Autonomy Testing:**
   - Set Level 1, ask "analyze this code: console.log('hello')"
   - Set Level 4, ask the same thing
   - Compare the different responses

2. **App Context Switching:**
   - Launch Writer AI
   - Ask it to help write a blog post
   - Exit and launch Code Agent  
   - Ask it to review code
   - Notice the context-aware responses

3. **System Integration:**
   - Change autonomy while in an app session
   - Watch the Visual Verifier while interacting
   - Use system commands mixed with natural language

This demonstrates a true AI-native operating system where AI isn't just a feature - it's the core interface and intelligence layer that powers the entire user experience.
