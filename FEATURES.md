### 2. **Powerful Terminal**
The terminal now supports:
```bash
# File operations
ls ./src                    # List directory contents
cat package.json           # Read file contents
write test.txt "Hello"     # Write to file

# Web search
search "LLM operating systems"

# Code execution
execute python "print('Hello from Python!')"
execute javascript "console.log('Hello from Node!')"

# System commands
status                     # System health check
memory                     # Memory usage stats
apps                       # Available applications

## ðŸŒŸ What Makes This Special

This isn't just another chatbot interface. It's a **complete operating system paradigm** where:

- **Natural language is the primary interface**
- **AI agents have real capabilities** (file ops, web search, code execution)
- **Autonomy is tunable and safe** with proper approval workflows
- **Everything is monitored and auditable** for transparency
- **Users maintain control** while benefiting from AI automation

The LLM-OS represents the future of human-computer interaction, where we move beyond traditional GUIs to **natural language operating systems** powered by AI.
